# Argos Checkout Bot

This bot does not have a config.json file so Anticaptcha API key must be written directly into the main.py file. There is a proxy.txt file where you can upload all of your proxies. Please note that proxies must not containe host domains, they must be ip addresses instead. This is because Anticaptcha is not compatible with residential proxies.
